      <description>One of the foundamental ideas on which Rotary is built is that projects should be sustainable. That&amp;rsquo;s why we - Rotary Club Sofia Triaditsa - are actively involved in preservation of our environment. We had participated in numerous iniciatives for afforistation and cultivating parks.
The trees provide us with oxygen and shade. They prevent landslides but are also play a crucial part of natural wildlife ecosystems. They are an integral part of preserving the water cycles and averting droughts.</description>

      <description>The amblyopia is a condition of a reduced eyesight. It is also known as &amp;ldquo;lazy eye&amp;rdquo;. By its nature it is not an eye disease but a neurological one. With it one eye becomes dominant and the brain rejects the image received by the other one.
Diagnosis and treatment As with any other disease, the sooner it is found - the better. This especially the case with ambliopia. Most of the times there are no visible indicators that someone has it.</description>
